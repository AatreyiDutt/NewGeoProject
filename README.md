# Censorship: New Geography of the Information Age
# Aatreyi Dutt
The censorship implemented by this web extension goes by China's guidelines for censorship:
    names of violent figures, govt's controversial events, things that may challenge the 
    principles of the constitution (for india it's communism challenging democracy), rude nicknames for
    figure in power, anti-government propaganda, jeopardising countrywide unity, harming honour/interests
    of nation, causing religious/ethnic tensions, insulting third parties, etc.
